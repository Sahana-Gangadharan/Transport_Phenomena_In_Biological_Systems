Course project - Modelling And Analysis Of Hyperalgesia Condition

This project was done as a part of the CFA exercise that is mandated to understand the course concepts better.

Modelling And Analysis Of Hyperalgesia Condition

Course: Transport Phenomena In Biological Systems | July 2019 - Nov 2019
Advisor: Prof. G. K. Suraishkumar

  1. Characterized the effects in “Hyperalgesia” condition (inc. sensitivity to pain) using NEURON.
  2. Studied various transport phenomena mechanisms in the brain.
  3. Modelled neuronal firing as a Poisson generation and analysed higher synaptic activity that causes Hyperalgesia.
